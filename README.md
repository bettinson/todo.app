This is my minimal todo app. You can add todos, clear them, edit them inline, and check them off.

## Things I learned

- Delegates
- Writing my own protocol
- How to use a model to supply data to a view controller
- UI code
- Creating custom cells
- Segues
- Saving to the local file system
- How to shut up and actually _make_ something instead of just reading books
